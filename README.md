# VAQUITA - RISC-V Vector Core


### Introduction:

"Vaquita" 🐬, named after the critically endangered Vaquita porpoise, represents a groundbreaking project at the intersection of technology, education, and environmental consciousness. It introduces the RISC-V vector extension, an enhancement to the RISC-V instruction set architecture that introduces powerful support for vector operations. This extension includes vector registers and a comprehensive suite of vector instructions, enabling efficient parallel processing of large datasets.

### Contributing:

We welcome contributions from the community to make VAQUITA even better.


Happy coding! 🚀
